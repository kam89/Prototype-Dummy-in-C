# dummy programs

## What is this?
This is a collection of **prototype/dummy** programs for further development.

I am working in a bank and sometimes I have to retrieve some logs/files for troubleshooting purpose.
A data checking program is required to mask (replace) the confidential data.
Also I need some tool to troubleshoot some application as well.
Therefore I have created some tool.

All the prototype/dummy programs are for personal interest only.
